# Blind Auction Program

This Python program simulates a **blind auction system** where multiple participants can place bids without seeing others' bids. Once all bids are entered, the program announces the winner with the highest bid.

## Features

- **Dynamic Input:** Allows multiple participants to join the auction.
- **Winner Announcement:** Determines and displays the highest bidder.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your name and bid amount when prompted.
3. Decide if there are other bidders and respond with "Yes" or "No."
4. Once all bids are entered, the winner will be announced.
